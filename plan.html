<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Anthony Elkins</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The overall goal is to create a website which would cater to people between the ages of 15-30 and increase the total of number of players by 50% from 100 to 150.</p>
<p>Creating a website which would cater towards the players by having easily accessible leader boards and announcements.</p>
<p>Making an online sign up which would allow perspective new players to show their wanting to join a team.</p>
<p>Having contact information which could be accessed via the website.</p>
<p>Lastly it will be required to inform players on the game Volleyball itself.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The first way to check the success of the website is to check how many players signed up to ensure that it made it to at least 150.</p>
<p>Check with the company that the website was made for to ensure that they got people from the target audience they wanted. (could maybe add the options for age to sign up)</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for the website was people from the age of 15-30 which was requested by the client.</p>
<p>The way which the website would cater to the target audience starts with the fact that most people from that age bracket would prefer to easily be able to sign up via the web than in person. Simple artistic choices like the font used or the colour scheme used was also chosen in light of the target audience as an older generation would prefer a more practical font and younger generations would prefer more images to create a more visual experience.</p>
